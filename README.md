## Quick Note
I used to have a lot more activity, but when I switched my email(Sep/2/2025) most contributions got whiped from profile history.  
You can find more information on what I've done Below. 

## Dev Accounts
These are channels and Youtube playlists that containing a good chunk of my projects since Mar/01/2024, where I first started to make video documentations
I have multiple accounts where i post devlogs on. My most common are:
Youtube [Theghost3907](https://www.youtube.com/@Theghost39077) With a Devlog [PLAYLIST](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Csq4bTd7BK2p6loLS_vJrAR73iMklcA).
  Older, is more focusted on c++ projects outside of Unreal Engine. Does trace back to some unreal projects but the focus has shifted.
  From Most Recent To Oldest you will see:
    Necro Civ - custom C++ engine and game development.
    Night Hunt - Some Unreal Engine Smart Object and EQS Work.
    Skeletons Uprising - Unreal Engine Wave Based Multiplayer FPS with Zombie like AI.

  Newer, Is more focused on Unreal Engine.
  From Most Recent To Oldest you will see:
    PFCS(Plant Factory Creator Simulator) - Current Development on Project in Unreal Engine Where you Play As a Biologist.

  Most Active, More Focused on General Development Updates Opposed to formated devlogs.


## About Me/History
I always liked the thought of videogame development growing up but I didn't start until 2019. Early 2019 is when I first got started with the programming side of things, with Roblox's dialect of Lua(Called "Luau"). After a couple months of using Official Roblox Scripting tutorials, I started to teach myself Blender by making my own models and basic color textures. Even though the Roblox Scripting tutorials are my not preferred way of learning, they provided you different maps that had issues and then teach you how to solve said issues, they are by far some of the best official resources I have used with exception of the large variance of video instructor quality.  

About a year later(Early to Mid 2020), I discovered Unreal Engine 4. With UE4, I taught myself blueprint scripting until the early access of Unreal Engine 5 released in mid 2021. After the new release, I switched over and begun creating things that were a little bigger and not fully based off tutorials. The following 3 years were me continuing on with learning Unreal 5 and Blender. Most of my Blender practice consisted of: UVs, texture painting, normal maps and animations. While Unreal's work was in material nodes. I started one of my biggest projects, Skeletons Uprising, within that time. 

January 2024 is when I first entered a game jam and since then, I have done two more. You can view them on my itch page [HERE](https://theghost3907.itch.io/), each of these were made in my spare time over the course of two weeks. Now I did not treat these as their own game and more of a thing I can use to get better at something, for example: Through the Dark was a reason for me to mess with how lighting works and Mechanical Air was me testing how Unreal treats assets as a whole, which I slightly regret but would do again if given the choice. You can actually watch most of my work on Mechanical Air, I have several livestreams near the end of my playlist portfolio.  

A little bit later, I began video documenting Skeletons Uprising. Throughout my work with Skeletons Uprising, I created many things from multiplayer replication to custom save states and deformations. Eventually I decided to put Skeletons Uprising on an indefinite hiatus and entered my current saga to go even further down the levels and begin making my own engine. I quickly found out that such a thing was impractical by itself so I started Necro Civ. Instead of creating an engine by itself, I decided to begin making games that use their own internal workings and move what works into an engine at a later point. Since the decision to make Necro Civ, I have built many systems from the ground up in C++. Everything from animation skinning to rendering to logistical paths have been loosely documented within my playlist.

## Code Samples

I have been slowly adding code samples that you can see within the theghost3907 repository if not there already. They consist of Necro Civ lower systems, like engine or shaders, opposed to gameplay or other things at the moment.
